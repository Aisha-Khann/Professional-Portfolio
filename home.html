        <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Welcome to my page! My name is Aisha, and I am a first year student currently studying Computer Science at the University of Guelph in Guelph ON, Canada. This page serves as a
              portfolio to get you to learn about me, my interests, background skills, career path and future goals. 
            </p>
            <p>I grew up in a small town in the Greater Toronto Area, Milton Ontario. This is where I graduated both elementary school
              and highschool. The highschool I went to was St. Francis Xavier Catholic Secondary, where I met many of my long term and current close friends. I am super close with my younger sister, Amna, and I have an older brother as well who's finishing up
              his degree in Electrical Engineering at Toronto Metropolitan University. I live with my two parents, my father works in Windsor, Ontario as a Mechanical Engineer and my mother works nearby in Quality Assurance. I'm super close with my family, and they've inspired me to become the 
              hard-working individual I am today.</p>
            <p>
              When I first moved to Milton at the age of 8, most areas were under construction and there were not too many 
              elementary schools and highschools, as well as there being only one mall, Walmart and Cineplex. As the years went by, Milton began expanding quite rapidly, and is not
              considered a town anymore, moreso a small city. Growing up in a small suburban town really spiked me to gain interest in the bigger city and what large companies and corporte jobs had to offer,
              as it was different from what I would usually see in my day to day life.
            </p>
            <p>Once I attained my license at 16, I started exploring other cities more often with friends and family. This influenced my interests in going out to discover new restauraunts, malls and outdoor activities. My hobbies and interests include
              spending time with friends and family, baking, artistry, shopping, makeup and beauty. I did not grow up playing too many sports, I did play soccer and badminton in elementary though.
              I love visiting Mississauga and Toronto to explore new food spots with my friends, as well as visit bigger shopping malls. On a day-to-day basis, my friends and I love driving around, grabbing coffee and going out to enjoy activities together. Summer is my favourite season,
              not just because my birthday falls in June, but I love spending time in the sun, enjoying sunsets, going for walks and longdrives, and enjoying cold-drinks, bonfires and barbeques.</p>

        <h2>Work Experience and Career</h2>
            <p>My work experience in my late teen years consisted of retail work, mostly at the Toronto Premium Outlets situated in Halton Hills, ON. I have been working there from summer 2022 to now, and I love working in retail due to my passion for fashion and my interests in socializing, as I do consider myself a more extroverted individual.
              I have worked at retail stores such as Calvin Klein, DKNY and Karl Lagerfeld. I really enjoy my role as both sales associate and cashier, as I love speaking and getting to know clients, as well as helping customers shop for what they're looking for.</p>
            <p>My passion for beauty and makeup inspired me to start a small business, LashedbyAisha where I sell faux mink strip lashes to many girls my age through Instagram DM. I had 
              never seen myself become an entrepreneur, but was inspired to once many girls showed interest in the eyelashes I would wear on a day to day basis. Currently, my page is doing quite well, and I am able to provide my services through both pick-up and drop-off in the GTA.
              In the future, I hope to expand a side-career in health and beauty, visualizing myself as an esthetician, nail artist, lash tech, makeup artist, or something of that nature.</p>
            <p>Outside of paid work, I have spent many hours volunteering and giving back to my community, especially when I had more time back in highschool. I had volunteered at kids summer camps, tutoring highschool
              Math and Calculus, participating in the Town of Milton's election Campaigns, Garbage Collection Day, holiday parades, as well as in organizations such as the Canadian Breast Cancer Foundation, and at elementary schools and their after-school events such as basketball games, play-day, etc. Volunteer work really helped build some of my collaborative skills, and also allowed me to
              appreciate my community and the things it had to offer.

        <h2>Background Skills</h2>
            <p>Growing up as a very studious and ambitious young individual, I gained a passion in studying subjects related to Math and Science. Throughout highschool and University, I displayed particular interest in Advanced Functions, Calculus, Physics, Discrete Mathematics, Statistics and Linear Algebra.
          My strong suit in math really influenced me to choose a math-load heavy career when planning my future. My skills in mathematics influenced me to tutor Functions, Advanced Functions and Calculus to students ranging from Grade 9 to Grade 12, as well as first years. This helped me gain
          an advanced skill in my mathematics, as well as expand my communication skills, collaboration skills, and create many connections with those who may have needed my help, which I was happy to offer.
        <p> My excellent performance in such courses led me to many scholarships and awards, including becoming an Honours Student on the Dean's List two semesters in a row, maintaining an above 80% average GPA, getting invited to the University of Guelph's 2023 Department of Chemistry's Awards Night, and receiving an Entrance scholarship in September 2022.</p>
        <p>I have also gained skill in Data Analysis, the use of Microsoft Excel, other softwares and editors both within and outside of programming projects. I'm quite familiar with technologies and frameworks such as Git, GitHub, GitLab, Visual Studio Code, CSS styling, etc. I'm able to construct many graphical representations when it comes to Data Analysis, especially after working in lab-work and research when pursuing my
          subjects of Biology and Chemistry. I can construct useful spreadsheets, scatterplots, histograms, bargraphs, linegraphs, etc. This can also be done through coding, as I have made several graphs in my Statistics course using R Studio.</p>
        <p>My personal skills include communication, collaboration and team-effort in pressured-environments, diligence, numeracy, alongside my tech-skills I have gained since pursuing my degree, which we will dive more into. I consider myself a very hard-working individual, who sets goals, maintains priorities and gets told such from colleagues, friends and family,
          both inside and outside the work-place.</p>
        <p>Outside of collaborative spaces, I believe I work well individually as well. I'm able to complete projects and tasks handed to me within a given time period with quality, thought and effort. I always try to perform my best with any task at hand, regardless of the importance of the final result. All of my managers say they love having me at the worksite due to this,
          they can always rely on me when needed, especially when it comes to important tasks such as maintaining the store environment in time for an audit or assessment.</p>
        <p>When it comes to group-work, my peers and coworkers do not have any issue with relying on me to get my part of a task done. I've been told I'm an excellent group member, and I usually take extra initiative to help my peers with their part of the work once I'm done mine.</p>

    <h2>Future Planning in Tech</h2>
  <p>Currently, I am studying for my degree in Bachelors of Computing Honours, majoring in Computer Science at the University of Guelph. I enjoy my small commute to the University, and thorughly enjoy what I'm studying, as it is quite math-heavy.
    Only a year into programming, I think I have fallen in love with coding, and enjoy creating personal projects in all sorts of languages including C, C++, Python, Python 3, R, R Studio, alongside discovering HTML code and LaTex.
    I hope to learn JavaScript over the course of this summer, and also refine my skills and what I've learned in C and Python. </p>
  <p>My passion in mathematics alongside helping others has influenced me to apply to Teaching Assistant Roles at my University, in courses such as Linear Algebra or Discrete Mathematics. I'm certain that I will not give up my passion in tutoring and teaching younger grades in math, that's something I will always love to do.</p>
  <p>My program consists of 4 co-op work-terms, where I am hopeful to gain some real work-place experience in programming, which will ultimately assist me in attaining a long-term career after the completion of my degree. I am 
    really looking forward to my co-op work terms, I can't wait to meet other programmers and software developers which will teach me so much for my future career.
  </p>
  <p>I really do appreciate hybrid work, both working remotely and in the office, this is also a factor towards pursuing my degree, as it entails a future in environments I do not have an issue adapting to. I'm really optimistic about what my future in tech has in store for me, especially with the rapid growth in 
    Artificial Intelligence, Cybersecurity and Software Development. So much of my own day-to-day activities incorporate the results of such skillsets, especially the use of Social Media, Youtube and the internet in general.
  </p>
  <p>What also excites me is being a young woman in such a field. The statstics show the ratio of men to women in computing as quite drastic, and it excites me to know that a young ambitious woman such as myself is about to step into this field with great visions and aspirations.</p>
